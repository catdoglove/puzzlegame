Finny was one of the most favorable animals to me since I first saw him.,Jenny's hostility never disappeared.,There are times when I feel an unknown emotion in the way Cotton looks at me.,He said "call me handsome bear" but I don't know why.,Alisa makes gummy bears for bears.,Dimber loves shiny things.,He knew that the lever was gone but he is bothersome. So he is just sitting there.,He knows that there is no fishing rod so can't catch fish but he is bothersome. So he is just sitting there.
